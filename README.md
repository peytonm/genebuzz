genebuzz
========

This is a tongue-in-cheek implementation of FizzBuzz using a genetic algorithm. Really, it's just a way for me to learn Clojure.

At the moment, it works, but it's not without flaws:
* A lot of memory is used.
* There are no tests.
* I'm guessing the fitness function could be improved.
* I won't claim to know idiomatic Clojure.
